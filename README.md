# Tiktoken

This is a C++ implementation of a tiktoken tokenizer library for C++.It is almost transliterated from https://github.com/dmitry-brazhenko/SharpToken

Due to some logistics that I have yet to come with an amenable solution for with regards to regex implementations, tokens using the latin alphabet only are supported.
